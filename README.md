## Beginner's Guide
Congratulations on beginning your career in cyber security! On this github you will find a schedule file. Check 
that out to see what material you'll be learning, and what you'll need to catch up on.

***BEFORE WE DELVE TOO DEEP, DO NOT OPEN LAB ZIP FILES UNTIL INSIDE YOUR ~SECURE~ VIRTUALMACHINE. THEY CONTAIN MALWARE FOR THE PURPOSE OF STUDY BUT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INFECT YOUR COMPUTER AND/OR NETWORK***

To get started you will first need the textbook (we use Practical Malware Analysis by Honig and Sikorski). 
The pdf version can be found on the above github in the resources folder.

Next you will need Kali Linux. For those who are brand new, Linux is another operating system like Windows or
MacOS. Kali is a distribution (or "flavor") of linux that comes with a multitude of pre-installed cyber security
tools. The file you need to download is known as an ISO (because it's a .iso or disk image file). This file can also be
found in the resources folder.

After Kali has been downloaded, you need virtualBox. VirtualBox is the software that allows us to run virtual machines.
Virtual Machines are essentially operating systems that you can run within a window of your current OS. That allows us
to use important tools without dual booting computers, experiment with live malware without putting ourselves at risk,
and do plenty of other interesting things like create computer networks! The virtualBox download can be found at virtualBox.org/wiki/Downloads. Just select whichever operating system you are using
to download.

Please follow the directions for setting up VM's file found in the resources folder as well.

The next step will be to read the first few chapters (at least chapters 1 and 2), and try your best to understand that material.
We will be here to help, but you should read through, work on the coordinating labs (found in Labs folder & in book), and do your best
to delve into the material.

Welcome! We're glad you're here!

# Malware Analysis - CSCI 4976
This repository contains the materials as developed and used by [RPISEC](http://rpis.ec) to
teach Malware Analysis at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://rpi.edu) in
Fall 2015. This was a university course developed and run soley by students, primarily using the
[Practical Malware Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Dissecting-Malicious/dp/1593272901)
book by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig, to teach skills in reverse engineering, malicious behaviour, malware,
and anti-analysis techniques.

## About the Course

The Practical Malware Analysis (PMA) book is where many RPISEC members and alumn started. The book reads very well,
is full of information, and the lab walkthroughs in the back are invaluable. We didn't want to re-invent the wheel so
we structured most of the class around the book. Students were expected to have read the relevant PMA book chapters
before class, allowing us to spend much more class time demonstrating skills and techniques and walking through
hands-on examples with the students.

**Syllabus:** http://security.cs.rpi.edu/courses/malware-fall2015/Syllabus.pdf

**Note: Most of the samples used in this course are malicious in nature, treat them carefully!**

To help protect people from accidentaly running samples on an important machine, and to prevent anti-malware suites from
blocking the course material, **all of the samples are compressed and encrypted with a password of 'infected'.**

### Course Abstract

>_With the increased use of the Internet and prevalence of computing systems in critical infrastructure, technology is undoubtedly a vital part of modern daily life. Unfortunately, the increasingly networked nature of the modern world has also enabled the spread of malicious software, or “malware”, ranging from annoying adware to advanced nation-state sponsored cyber-weaponry. As a result, the ability to detect, analyze, understand, control, and eradicate malware is an increasingly important issue of economic and national security._

>_This course will introduce students to modern malware analysis techniques through readings and hands-on interactive analysis of real-world samples. After taking this course students will be equipped with the skills to analyze advanced contemporary malware using both static and dynamic analysis._

### Prerequisite Knowledge
This course carried a prereq of
[Computer Organization - CSCI 2500](http://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=10&coid=16571)
at RPI. Computer Organization is RPI's basic computer architecture course that teaches
things like C, MIPS assembly, x86 assembly, Datapaths, CPU Pipelining, CPU Caching,
Memory Mapping, etc.

Our expected demographic for Malware Analysis was students with zero reverse
engineering experience. That said, to be able to take this course
you will probably need at least the following skills.
* Working knowledge of C/C++
* Any assembly level experience

## Analysis Environment

Setting up a "safe" and usable analysis environment can range from easy to impossible,
depending on how far you want to go. The PMA book devotes an
entire chapter (Chapter 2) to this problem. For the purposes of this class, we
decided to set up a Windows 7 32-bit virtual machine. Unfortunately, while all the software
we used for the class is free, Windows is not, thus we cannot distribute this VM like we
distributed the Warzone for MBE. We have, however, included a comprehensive list, and a
collection of installers, of all the tools we used throughout the course. There are a few 
"essentials" that we haven't listed but are still included in the installer package 
(python, cygwin, etc).

## Frequently Asked Questions

If you are ever stuck on a problem or have any questions, you're more than welcome to
ask on [IRC](#contact).

#### What is the password to the zip files?
'infected', no quotes.

#### Are these files malicious/dangerous?
Yes. Not all of them are malicious in nature, but most are. Always keep them inside a
proper analysis environment.

#### Why are the lecture slides for XYZ so sparse?
Much of lecture time was spent in hands on examples, with the expectation that students
had read the material in the PMA book ahead of time. Thus the slide content referring
to material from the PMA book is meant as more of an outline. Read the chapters and then
go through the lab walkthroughs in the back of the PMA book, they are a great resource.

#### Do you have videos of the lectures?
Sadly we did not record any of the lectures, maybe next time.

#### Where can I learn more?
Play more wargames:
* [IO Wargame](https://io.netgarage.org/)
* [Pwnable KR](http://pwnable.kr/)
* [Pwnable TW](https://pwnable.tw/)
* [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/)
* [Reversing KR](http://reversing.kr/)
* [W3Challs](http://w3challs.com/)
* [crackmes.de](http://crackmes.de/)

* [Malware.lu](https://malware.lu/)
* [malwr](https://malwr.com/)
* [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/recent-submissions?filter=file)

The following books are excellent resources for expanding your knowledge of malware analysis and reverse engineering. We recommend working through them in the following order:

* Practical Malware Analysis
* Practical Reverse Engineering
* Rootkits: Subverting the Windows Kernel
* The Rootkit Arsenal: Escape and Evasion in the Dark Corners of the System
* Rootkits and Bootkits: Reversing Modern Malware and Next Generation Threats

These three books are also excellent:

* The Antivirus Hacker's Handbook
* The Art of Memory Forensics
* Windows Internals

And when they're happening, play [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/)!
